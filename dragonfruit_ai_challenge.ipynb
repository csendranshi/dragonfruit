    "1. Come up with efficient data structures to represent both types of images: those generated\n",
    "by the microscope, and those generated by the dye sensor. These need not have the same\n",
    "representation; the only requirement is that they be compact and take as little storage\n",
    "space as possible. Explain why you picked the representation you did for each image type,\n",
    "and if possible estimate how much storage would be taken by the images. What is the\n",
    "worst-case storage size in bytes for each image representation you chose?"

    "> Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Since microscope images only consist of black (blob) and white (background) pixels, we can represent them using a sparse matrix data structure. A sparse matrix is suitable because most of the pixels in the image will be white (background), so we only need to store the coordinates of the black pixels (blob).\n",
    "\n",
    "One efficient way to represent this is using a dictionary (or hash map) where the keys are the coordinates of the black pixels and the values are either a boolean flag or a fixed value indicating the presence of the blob.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Storage calculation assuming each coordinate requires 4 bytes,\n",
    "\n",
    "> Total number of black pixels (assuming worst-case) = 100,000 * 100,000 = 10^10 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Total storage = 10^10 pixels * 4 bytes/pixel = 40 GB\n",
    "\n",
    "For the dye sensor images, we need to efficiently store information about which pixels contain dye. Similar to microscope images, we can use a sparse matrix representation to store only the coordinates of the lit pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, a dictionary (hash map) could be used where keys represent the coordinates of lit pixels, and values indicate the presence of dye. The storage rquiremwnts would be similar to that of the microscope images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is an exmaple of the approach. I've used just 100 pixels for the size of image given my local machine's computing power."

    "To solve the challenge, I used Python along with libraries such as NumPy for computations. I employed sparse matrix data structures to efficiently represent microscope and dye sensor images due to their suitability for handling large images with a significant amount of empty space. Algorithm optimization techniques were applied to improve runtime performance, minimizing redundant iterations and utilizing efficient data structures and operations. Additionally, I utilized Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compression to reduce storage space for simulated images, a simple yet effective compression method. The simulation of images was achieved using random data generation techniques. While I didn't directly utilize Large Language Model (LLM) techniques, my responses were informed by the extensive knowledge ingrained within the model, allowing me to propose effective solutions to the given problem"
